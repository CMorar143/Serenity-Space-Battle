### Story Synopsis
The basic idea of the story is based heavily off the movie. It is set in the 26th century, by then humans have become an interstellar species, trekking to another solar system. The government known as the Allegience now rules the newly colonised solar system. A woman known as River Tam has uncovered well-kept secrets held by top government officials. She finds herself in the company of two smugglers, captains of the Serenity, who have been tasked with helping River Tam disseminate these secrets. They are on their way to meet with a hacker who can help broadcast this message. The broadcast could bring down the Allegience, putting an end to their tyranny. Being fully aware of this, the Allegience creates a blockade with the hope of destroying the Serenity and protecting their incriminating secrets. An epic space battle ensues.
